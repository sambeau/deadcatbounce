# Dead-Cat Bounce

A German-style trading board-game design played with a standard pack of cards.

## Concept

#### dead-cat bounce *(noun)*
1. *Slang.* A temporary recovery in stock prices after a steep decline, often resulting from the purchase of securities that have been sold short.

Dead-Cat Bounce is a trading game played with a pack of cards and some tokens to act as money. It is loosely based around the concept of buying and selling stocks and shares. It falls into the Rummy family of games, so has melds of sets and runs, which in this case represent the stocks and shares. Dead-Cat Bounce expands on the basic rummy game, turning into a trading game, by introducing money, dividends, tax and hostile takeovers.

## Rules
### Equipment
- A pack of standard cards.
- Tokens, approximately 25 per person.

### Players
- It works well with 4 players and one pack of cards.
- We intend to experiment with adding extra suits for more players.

### Set-up
1. Shuffle the pack.
2. Deal each player 2 cards.
3. Place the pack in the middle of the table, face down, slightly to one side to allow space for four cards in a row next to it.
4. Give each player 7 tokens as starting capital.
5. Store the other tokens together as the ‘bank’.

### Order of play
- Clockwise or anti-clockwise, it makes no difference.
- Experienced adults: left/right of dealer.
- Mixed ages: youngest goes last.
- Mixed experience: new player goes last.

### Start
1. Deal a three card ‘flop’ to the right of the pack and turn them over for everyone to see.
2. Keep a space to the right of the flop for the discard pile
3. The first player starts their turn. As they won’t have any sets or runs, any fees to pay, etc. they can go straight to buying stock.

### Turn
Turns have phases that are completed in order:
1. Housekeeping
2. Trade
3. Protect
4. Pay Tax

### Housekeeping
In order:
1. **Pay your fees:** any tokens placed on your sets and runs are removed and placed in the bank.
2. **Replenish the stocks:** move any cards in the flop towards the discard pile on the right, fill in the gaps to the left to make sure there are 3 cards in the flop.
3. **Pay dividends:** Calculate dividends and pay the player from the bank (see dividends below).

### Trade
In any order:
- **Buy New Stock:** Any cards in the flop can be bought at their _nominal price_
- **Trade With Other players:** Players are free to buy, sell and swap any cards they have on display or in their hand.
- **Hostile Takeover:** Players are free to buy any sets & runs on display by other players, as long as the full **inflated** price is paid in-full.
- **Sell to the bank:** any card on display or in your hand can be sold to the bank. The bank pays 1 token per card, even for Aces.
- **Build runs:** two or more cards of consecutive order and of the same suit can be placed onto the table to create a run. Cards can be added to the top or bottom of runs to make them longer.
- **Build sets:** two (a pair) or more cards of the same rank can be placed on the table. Cards can be added to sets to make them wider.
- **pay to see extra flop cards:** as long as there are less than 3 cards in the flop, you can spend one token to fill them. You can then buy them if you want, but have to pay the nominal price for them.
### Protect your investments
1. **Inflate prices to protect your investments:** Place extra tokens onto any sets and runs you want to inflate the price of, to protect from hostile takeover.
### Pay Tax
1. Cards held in your hand are taxed at one token per card, paid directly to the bank.
	- Taxes must be paid, if you don’t have enough for tax, something must be sold either to the bank (which pays one token per card), or to another player (who might be more generous).
2. Once tax has been paid, your turn is over and play passes to the next player.

### Nominal prices
These are the standard prices used when buying anything from the bank, and when the bank pays out dividends.

- **3**-**10**: 1 token
- **2**, **J**: 2 tokens
- **Q**: 3 tokens
- **K**: 4 tokens
- **A**: 5 tokens
